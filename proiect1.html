               <h3 class="resume-subtitle">Chocolate Cake - 9$</h3>
               <p> With its fudgy-yet-fluffy layers and swirls of creamy frosting, is synonymous with the leg-twisting delight you felt as a kid, tackling a slice the size of your head and getting it all over your face in the process. It is a first date, butterflies in your stomach shared dessert — two forks.  </p>
               <h3 class="resume-subtitle">Chocolate Eclair - 5$</h3>
               <p> The French Éclair is known around the world, it is one of the greatest cakes ever! Éclair means “flash of lightning” and quite why it’s called that is not 100% known but many say that it is an old joke of pastry makers that the éclair is eaten “in a flash”!</p>
               <h3 class="resume-subtitle">Chocolate Ice Cream - 7$</h3>
               <p> The Best Chocolate Ice Cream is a bold name, but it is equally matched by the bold chocolate flavor of this custard-based ice cream. It’s creamy and rich, decadently sweet, and it will make any chocolate lover swoon.</p>

              <h3 class="resume-subtitle">Why do we love chocolate?</h3>
            </div>
            <p>The answer could be simple: because it has an excellent taste, but it is more complex than that. Chocolate truly has a divine taste, regardless of the variety, but the real reasons why we like it so much are related to the chemical reactions it causes in the body. Thus, it has been demonstrated that breast milk has the closest sugar-fat ratio to chocolate, hence our preferences for this dessert. In addition, thanks to the chemical compounds in the cocoa beans, chocolate relaxes us, gives us a good mood and even helps the brain to a great extent.</p>
